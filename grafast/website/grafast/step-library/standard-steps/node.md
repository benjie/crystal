# node

A step to get a Node by it's global object identifier (string). Accepts an
object specifying the supported codecs, an object map detailing the typeNames
supported and their details (codec to use, how to find the record, etc), and
finally the Node id string plan, typically supplied from an argument.

Usage:

```ts
const $nodeIdString = fieldArgs.get("id");
const $node = node(codecs, handlers, $nodeIdString);
```

## codecs

A node identifier is a string that uniquely identifies an entity in the GraphQL
schema for the lifetime of that entity.

A codec is responsible for parsing and deparsing this string. There are many
different ways of encoding node identifiers, so we allow for many different
codecs.

A code is made of two methods:

- `encode` takes an intermediate representation and turns it into the final node identifier string
- `decode` takes the final node identifier string and turns it back into an intermediate representation

This intermediate representation is produced by and consumed by the handlers
(see below).

Here's an example `base64JSONCodec` which simply JSON stringifies the
intermediate representation and then base64 encodes it:

```js
function base64JSONEncode(value: any): string | null {
  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(value), "utf8").toString("base64");
}
base64JSONEncode.isSyncAndSafe = true; // Optimization

function base64JSONDecode(value: string): any {
  return JSON.parse(Buffer.from(value, "base64").toString("utf8"));
}
base64JSONDecode.isSyncAndSafe = true; // Optimization

const base64JSONCodec = {
  encode: base64JSONEncode,
  decode: base64JSONDecode,
};

const codecs = {
  base64JSON: base64JSONCodec,
  // Add more codecs here
};
```

## handlers

Each GraphQL object type that supports the `Node` interface must have its own
`NodeIdHandler`. This handler indicates the object type's name, the codec to
use (see above), and supports the following operations:

- `plan` - takes an entity of the given object type and return a step
  representing the intermediate representation for this entity
- `match` - determines whether a given intermediate representation of a node
  identifier string relates to this type or not
- `getSpec` - builds a "specification" of the entity from a step representing a
  matching intermediate representation
- `get` - given the specification from `getSpec` above, returns a step
  representing the entity identified by the matching node identifier string, if
  it exists

Specifications (returned from `getSpec`) may differ for each object type. They
could be something simple like just a step that represents the numeric primary
key in the database, or they may be more complex such as an object with
multiple keys where each key's value is a step representing a related value to
match in the remote source.

Here's an example of a `userHandler`, which could be used across a schema when
handling node identifiers for the `User` type:

```js
const USER = "User";

const userHandler = {
  typeName: USER,

  codecName: "base64JSON",

  // Given a User record, return a step describing the data to be encoded by
  // the codec:
  plan($user: PgSelectSingleStep) {
    return list([constant(USER), $user.get("id")]);
  },

  // Given the data decoded by the codec, determine if the data is for our
  // type. In this particular handler, the check looks at the first entry in
  // the list to see if it matches our type name.
  match(list) {
    return list[0] === USER;
  },

  // Given a step representing decoded data that passes the `match` test above,
  // return a specifier object that can be used to retrieve or reference
  // this entity.
  getSpec($list: ListStep<any[]>) {
    return {
      id: access($list, 1),
    };
  },

  // Given a spec (the result of `getSpec` above), return a step that resolves
  // to the entity (if found).
  get(spec: any) {
    return pgResource.get(spec);
  },
};

const handlers = {
  User: userHandler,
  // Add more handlers here
};
```

## specFromNodeId

Given you have a Node ID represented by the step `$id` and you already know
what type it should be (e.g. for an `updateUser` mutation you might know that
the `$id` should represent a `User`), you can use `specFromNodeId` passing the
relevant codec and handler to get a specification for the entity in question.
This is typically useful when you want to mutate an entity without having to
actually retrieve it (if you want to retrieve it then use `node()` above
instead).

If the codec/handler doesn't match then the executable steps inside the
resulting spec will resolve to null-ish values (or maybe raise an error).

```ts
function specFromNodeId(
  codec: NodeIdCodec<any>,
  handler: NodeIdHandler<any>,
  $id: ExecutableStep<string>,
): any;
```

TODO: `specFromNodeId` should either accept `codecs` (rather than `codec`) or
should _just_ accept `handler` and `handler` should embed the codec directly
rather than just its name - probably the latter.

Here's an example of an `updateUser` mutation that uses
the `userHandler` example handler from above:

```js
const typeDefs = /* GraphQL */ `
  extend type Mutation {
    updateUser(id: ID!, patch: UserPatch!): UpdateUserPayload
  }
`;

const plans = {
  Mutation: {
    updateUser(parent, fieldArgs) {
      // Get the "id" from args:
      const $nodeId = fieldArgs.get("id");

      // Turn the $nodeId into a specifier:
      const spec = specFromNodeId(base64JSONCodec, userHandler, $nodeId);

      // Now use this specifier to plan an update for this user:
      const $result = pgUpdate(userSource, spec);

      // Leave space in our result so we can add more properties later:
      const $payload = object({ result: $result });

      // Apply all the plans from the 'patch' argument (omitted for brevity):
      fieldArgs.apply($payload);

      // Return the payload plan:
      return $payload;
    },
  },
};
```
