# Getting started

## Installation

&ZeroWidthSpace;<grafast /> is an alternative _execution_ layer for GraphQL; we still need GraphQL.js
for building the schema, and parsing and validating requests. So the first thing
you need to do to get started is to install `grafast` and `graphql`:

```
yarn install grafast graphql
```

or with `npm`:

```
npm install --save grafast graphql
```

Other package managers are available :wink:

:::note

We intend to write up a specification so that other languages may implement the
Grafast execution strategy, but for now Grafast is JavaScript/TypeScript only.

:::

If you have an existing GraphQL.js schema, you can run it through Grafast ─ see
[using with an existing schema](./existing-schema).

## My first plan

Let's build a simple GraphQL schema powered by Grafast plans and query it.

:::info

There are many ways to build a GraphQL schema, we're going to use the "schema
first" approach in this example, but there's no reason that a Grafast schema
couldn't be produced "code first" or "database first" or any other approach.

:::

First, lets define our GraphQL schema. We're going to go with an incredibly
simple schema with a single field that adds together its two arguments:

```ts
const typeDefs = /* GraphQL */ `
  type Query {
    addTwoNumbers(a: Int!, b: Int!): Int
  }
`;
```

Now we need to define the `plans` for the schema. The plan for our
`Query.addTwoNumbers` field is to [read the arguments][field args], then use the
[lambda][] step to add them together. The lambda step takes a list of other
steps, and then determines the result by calling the given callback for each set
of resulting values.

```ts
const { lambda } = require("grafast");

const plans = {
  Query: {
    addTwoNumbers(_, args) {
      const $a = args.get("a");
      const $b = args.get("b");
      return lambda([$a, $b], ([a, b]) => a + b);
    },
  },
};
```

:::tip

`lambda` is a bit of an escape hatch ─ it enables one-by-one processing of
values rather than the batched processing that Grafast prefers for efficiency.
It can be handy as a utility function when batching would confer no benefit,
but in general you should pick a [more suitable step][step library].

:::

To turn this into a schema, we can use the `makeGrafastSchema` helper which will
stitch the `typeDefs` and the `plans` together:

```ts
const { makeGrafastSchema } = require("grafast");

const schema = makeGrafastSchema({
  typeDefs,
  plans,
});
```

Finally, we can run our query:

```ts
const { grafastSync } = require("grafast");

const result = grafastSync({
  schema,
  source: /* GraphQL */ `
    {
      addTwoNumbers(a: 40, b: 2)
    }
  `,
});
```

The result is what we'd expect:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "addTwoNumbers": 42
  }
}
```

:::info

Our schema is so simple the query could be ran synchronously with `grafastSync`,
but most queries in the real world should be executed through `grafast` and will
return a promise, or even an async iterable for `@stream`, `@defer`,
subscriptions and similar!

:::

We could then [serve this schema over HTTP][servers] using a server such as
[grafserv][] or any [envelop-capable server][envelop].

## My first step class

The building blocks of an operation plan are "steps." Steps are instances of
"step classes," and Grafast makes available a modest range of [standard steps][]
that you can use; but when these aren't enough you can write your own. Full
details for doing so can be found in [Step classes][], but let's build ourselves
a simple one now to replace the `lambda` usage above.

Step classes extend the `ExecutableStep` class, the only required method to
define is `execute`.

```ts
const { ExecutableStep } = require("grafast");

class AddStep extends ExecutableStep {
  constructor($a, $b) {
    super();
    this.addDependency($a);
    this.addDependency($b);
  }

  execute(count, [allA, allB]) {
    // allA and allB are guaranteed to have the same length. We have to return
    // a list with the same length as allA and allB, so in this case we can
    // simply map:
    return allA.map((a, i) => {
      return a + allB[i];
    );
  }
}
```

By convention, we always define a function that calls our class so we don't see
the `new` calls in our plan resolver functions. This makes them easier to read,
but the layer of abstraction often allows us to do some minor manipulations
before handing off to the class constructor.

```ts
function add($a, $b) {
  return new AddStep($a, $b);
}
```

Now we can use this method to add our numbers, rather than the lambda plan:

```diff
 const plans = {
   Query: {
     addTwoNumbers(_, args) {
       const $a = args.get("a");
       const $b = args.get("b");
-      return lambda([$a, $b], ([a, b]) => a + b);
+      return add($a, $b);
     },
   },
 };
```

You may well be able to write an entire Grafast schema using off-the-shelf step
classes, but it's worth being aware of how step classes work in case you want to
push your optimizations further. [Read more about step classes][step classes],
