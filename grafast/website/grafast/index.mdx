# <grafast /> introduction

The GraphQL specification describes how a GraphQL operation should be executed,
talking in terms of layer-by-layer resolution of data using "resolvers." But
critical to note is this sentence from the beginning of the specification:

> _Conformance requirements [...] can be fulfilled [...] in any way as long as
> the perceived result is equivalent._  
> â”€ https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Conforming-Algorithms

Resolvers are relatively straightforward to understand, but when implemented
naively can very quickly result in serious performance issues. [DataLoader][] is
one of the approaches suggested to solve the "N+1 problem," but this is only the
most egregious performance issue that a naive GraphQL schema may face - there
are others such as server-side over-fetching and under-fetching and related
issues that can really build up as your schemas and operations get more complex.

<grafast /> was designed from the ground up to eliminate these issues and more
whilst maintaining pleasant APIs for developers to use. To do this, in addition
to supporting resolvers for legacy fields, <grafast /> favors a planning strategy
that takes a holistic approach to understanding the incoming operation, and
unlocks the potential for significant optimizations not previously achievable
without a herculean effort.

Please note that <grafast /> is not tied to any particular storage or business logic
layer - any valid GraphQL schema could be implemented with <grafast />, and a
<grafast /> schema can query any data source or business logic that Node.js can
query.

## Planning

_This is just an overview, for full documentation see
[Plan Resolvers](./plan-resolvers)._

Where in a traditional schema you would add a "resolver," in a <grafast /> schema
you would instead add a "plan resolver." These plan resolvers are generally
small functions, like regular resolvers should be, but instead of being called
many times and dealing with concrete runtime values, they are called only once
at planning time and they build and manipulate "steps" which are the building
blocks of an execution plan.

Imagine that we have this GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  currentUser: User
}
type User {
  name: String!
  friends: [User!]!
}
```

In [graphql-js][], you might have these resolvers:

```ts
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async currentUser(_, args, context) {
      return context.userLoader.load(context.currentUserId);
    },
  },
  User: {
    name(user) {
      return user.full_name;
    },
    async friends(user, args, context) {
      const friendships = await context.friendshipsByUserIdLoader.load(user.id);
      const friends = await Promise.all(
        friendships.map((friendship) =>
          context.userLoader.load(friendship.friend_id),
        ),
      );
      return friends;
    },
  },
};
```

In <grafast />, we use "plan resolvers" instead, which might look something like:

```ts
const planResolvers = {
  Query: {
    currentUser() {
      return userById(context().get("currentUserId"));
    },
  },
  User: {
    name($user) {
      return $user.get("full_name");
    },
    friends($user) {
      const $friendships = friendshipsByUserId($user.get("id"));
      const $friends = each($friendships, ($friendship) =>
        userById($friendship.get("friend_id")),
      );
      return $friends;
    },
  },
};
```

As you can see, the shape of the logic is quite similar, but the <grafast /> plan
resolvers are synchronous since their job isn't to get the data to use, but
instead to outline the steps required to get the data. As the `friends` <grafast />
plan resolver cannot explicitly loop through the data (it hasn't been fetched
yet!), it uses an `each` helper to detail which steps to take for each item made
available later.

:::tip

By convention, when a variable represents a <grafast /> step, the variable will be
named starting with a `$`.

:::

If we were to make a request to the above <grafast /> schema with the following
query:

```graphql
{
  currentUser {
    name
    friends {
      name
      friends {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<grafast /> would build an operation plan for the operation, which for the above
query is:

<Mermaid chart={mermaidPlan} />

This action should only happen once for each new GraphQL operation that's seen,
when the same operation is seen again its existing plan can (generally) be
reused.

The "operation plan" diagram you see above is the final form of the plan, there
were many intermediate states that it will have gone through in order to reach
this most optimal form, made possible by Graphast's plan lifecycle.

## Plan Lifecycle

_This is just an overview, for full documentation see [lifecycle][lifecycle]._

All plan lifecycle methods are optional, and due to the always-batched nature of
<grafast /> plans you can get good performance without using any of them. However,
if you leverage them, your performance can go from "good" to :sparkles: amazing
:rocket:.

One of the great things about <grafast />'s design is that you don't need to build
these optimizations from the start; you can implement them at a later stage,
making your schema faster without requiring changes to your business logic _or_
your plan resolvers!

As a very approximate overview:

- when a field is planned we **deduplicate** each new step
- once the operation plan is complete, we **optimize** each step
- finally, we **finalize** each step

### Deduplicate

**Deduplicate** lets a step indicate which of its siblings (defined by <grafast />)
are equivalent to it. One of these siblings can then, if possible, replace the
new step, thereby reducing the number of steps in the plan.

### Optimize

**Optimize** lets a step "talk" to its ancestors, typically to tell them about
data that will be needed. This should not change the observed behavior of the
ancestor (e.g. you should not use it to apply filters to an ancestor!) but it
can be used to ask the ancestor to fetch additional data. This method can also
be used to replace the step with an alternative (presumably more-optimal) step.

In the "friends" example above, this was used to change the DataLoader-style
`select * from ...` query to a more optimal `select id, full_name from ...`
query. In more advanced plans (for example those made available through
[@dataplan/pg][]), optimize can go much further, for example inlining its data
requirements into a parent and replacing itself with a simple "mapper" function.

### Finalize

**Finalize** is the final method called on a step, it gives the step a chance to
do anything that it would generally only need to do once; for example a step
that issues a GraphQL query might take this opportunity to build the GraphQL
query string once. A step that converts a tuple into an object might build an
optimized function to do so.

## Further optimizations

<grafast /> doesn't just help your schema to execute fewer and more efficient steps,
it also optimizes how your data is output once it has been determined. This
means that even without making a single change to your existing GraphQL schema
(i.e. without adopting plans), running it though <grafast /> rather than graphql-js
should result in a modest speedup, and an even better one if you need to output
your result as a string (e.g. over a network socket/HTTP).

## Convinced?

If you're not convinced, please do reach out via the [Graphile Discord][] with
your queries, we'd love to make improvements to both this page, and <grafast />
itself!
