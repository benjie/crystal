ðŸš¨ makeWrapPlansPlugin callback is now passed `build` rather than `options` -
use `build.options` to get the options object. ðŸš¨ makeWrapPlansPlugin filters
now accept only three args (`context`, `build`, `field`) since the fourth
argument (`options`) was redundant - get it from `build.options` instead.
