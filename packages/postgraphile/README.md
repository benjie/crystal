_**Instant lightning-fast GraphQL API backed primarily by your PostgreSQL database. Highly customisable and extensible thanks to incredibly powerful plugin system.**_

An incredibly low-effort way to build a well structured and high-performance GraphQL API backed primarily by a PostgreSQL database. Our main focusses are performance, automatic best-practices and customisability/extensibility. Use this if you have a PostgreSQL database and you want to use it as the "source of truth" for an auto-generated GraphQL API (which you can still make significant changes to). **NOTE**: thanks to [graphile-exporter][] you can also use this as a starting point for an API that you then manage yourself.
